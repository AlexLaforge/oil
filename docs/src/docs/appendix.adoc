| Term | Explanation
| OIL | Stands for opt-in Layer and besides the fact that it stand for the name of the product it is often used to refer to the UI layer shown on the page.
| Site opt-in (SOI) | The __Site opt-in__ (SOI) stores a user's opt-in permit for the current site.
| Power opt-in (POI)  | The __Power opt-in__ (POI) functionality stores the opt-in permits centrally for multiple Axel Springer sites (for example BILD, WELT). This allows users to only give their opt-in permit once, when visting another site using POI the user will not be asked again. __POI__ is implemented via an iframe solution, see also __Hub__ . A user can first give a SOI permit before giving a POI permit, which has priority.
| Hub | __POI__ is implemented via an iframe solution that points to a hub site that acts as a third party cookie storage. Technically, the hub consists of a hub.html and hub.js.
| Subscriber | A site (for example WELT.de) that subscribes to a POI hub
