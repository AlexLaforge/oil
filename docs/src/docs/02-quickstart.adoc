== Quickstart

* Add OIL to your website, with a tag manager like <<adding-oil-js-to-your-site-via-tealium-recommended,tealium>> or <<adding-oil-js-to-your-site-via-direct-integration,directly>> as a tag
* Add your <<configuring-oil,configuration>> tag, for example:

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "activate_poi": true,
    "poi_group_name": "axelSpringerSe_01",
    "locale": "enEN_01"
  }
</script>
----

* <<styling-guide,Style>> your layer according to your style guide
* If needed: Create your own <<supported-languages,language pack>> and create your own <<supported-poi-groups,POI group>> (currently only possible by mail to the developers, a UI is currently worked on)
