=== Kameleoon A/B Testing with OIL

If you want to optimize and test your OIL installation with our Kameleoon A/B testing, you also need to include the right kameleoon script into your website, which will alter the optics and behaviour of OIL according to the test and your specific environment.

An example link would look like:
[source,html]
----
<script type="text/javascript" src="//static-bp.kameleoon.com/css/customers/xxxxxxxxxxx/0/kameleoon.js"></script>
----

Instead of xxxxxxxxxxx the right hash needs to be present, so Kameleoon knows which website it deals with. When we setup OIL A/B testing on your page this hash needs to be generated within Kameleoon.
