== How to implement OIL on your site

=== Quick Overview
1. Create Tealium configuration
2. Create OIL configuration
3. Deploy, reload and you're done!

=== 1. Tealium Configuration

The Tealium integration of Oil.js has not yet been completed for company-wide use in production. We keep you up to date and will update the instructions here accordingly.

=== 2. OIL Configuration

You need to add an OIL configuration to the html of your host and hub site. This is an example configuration:

[source,json]
----
    <script type="application/configuration">
      {
        "activate_poi": true,
        "hub_origin": "//www.somedomain.com",
        "hub_path": "/some/path.html",
        "subscriber_set_cookie": true,
        "opt_in_event_name": "oil_optin_done_custom",
        "opt_later_event_name": "oil_optlater_custom",
        "opt_out_event_name": "oil_optout_trigger",
        "developer_mode": "true"
      }
    </script>
----
