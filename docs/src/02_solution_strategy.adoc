== Solution Strategy


According the proposal of the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of Ministers, web browsers (and similar software) will be required to prompt users with a menu of privacy options when they are installed for the first time.[1] The menu options will range from an extreme ban on all cookies to acceptance of all cookies, and will include intermediate options such as "reject third-party cookies"‚Äù" or "only accept first-party cookies".

So solve this issue the ASV Opt In Layer (OIL) offers the basics to implement these requirements. Therefore the solution consists of two parts:

* A **hub**, which is added as an iframe to the site which is pointing to a new 3rd-party domain, which is independent from all current sites
* A **subscriber**, which communicates with this hub to get the the needed information from the hub

So when a user give the Power Opt In (POI) the subscriber sends a message via postMessage to the hub to inform the activation of the 3rd party cookie. By setting the cookie in the hub the 3rd party cookie became then a 1st party cookie. For some even stricter browsers, e.g. newer Safari versions footnote:[Chrome maybe also disable it by default in the future] a fallback is implemented which redirects then the user to hub site to set the cookie and then redirects back. But this fallback is only needed for the first visit.

On MSIE the postMessage function used only accepts strings, see http://kohsuke.org/2012/09/11/internet-explorer-only-takes-string-in-html5-postmessage/[here].
