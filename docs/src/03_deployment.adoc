== Deployment View

[NOTE]
====
For the purpose of the PoC the deployment to Tealium is done mainly manual for following stages:
- prod
- debug / development

Only the end2end stage has an "automatic" update via a CDN.

=== Hub Deployment
To deploy the hub (i.e. as a MyPass service) you need to deploy the project with an index.html loading dist/hub.123.js. In our examples this is demos/complete-integration-mypass.html

For compatibility with Internet Explorer 9+ you need to add the following header to the server response to allow 3rd party cookies for POI. It's needed in SOI only mode.

[source,json]

include::{project_root}/etc/headerConfig.js[tags=p3p-config]

=== Tealium Deployment
For our PoC we decided to use Tealium to deliver our Javascript artefact to client browsers. To achieve this you have to follow some steps:

As a developer of Oil.js (see image below)

* Open your Tealium lib profile and move to extensions
* Open the predefined Javascript extension "AS Opt-in Overlay"
* Some forms will show up, paste your code (dist/subscriber.123.js) in the "configuration" section
* Save and Publish your Tealium configuration changes in your desired stages (Dev, QA, Prod)

Please note that once published, your code will be delivered to all Tealium clients automatically.
Tealium clients will be informed of your changes and need to publish/deploy their profile to activate your changes.

As a client of Tealium (see image below)

* Open your Tealium profile and move to "extensions"
* Find the entry for "AS Opt-in Overlay", you'll be noticed of a change to this extension
* Publish / deploy your profile to activate the changes to Oil.js

.JavaScript Code Extension
Within an extension it's possible to handle the OptOut/OptIn logic during preload. This also allows to alter the later behaviour within Tealium.

.Configuration ddsd

You need to add a OIL configuration to the html of your host site. This is an example configuration:
